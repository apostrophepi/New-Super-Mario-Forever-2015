# New-Super-Mario-Forever-2015
A decompilation of the Softendo Super Mario fan-game.

Made out of pure boredom.

This decompilation may be buggy or incompatible with modern GML! 
The game was made in Game Maker 8, decompiled to that engine, imported to Game Maker Studio 1.4, and then imported to Game Maker Studio 2.

You'll likely have to fix the errors yourself. I am by no means a good coder.
